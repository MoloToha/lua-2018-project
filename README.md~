# lua-2018-project
# Project description
A small microframework for Web development which supports simple routing, template rendering and other minor things like logging, session handling, etc.

# Project phases
- **Phase 1**: research available instruments. We need at least: HTTP library, existing HTML template language for Lua. Prepare a little prototype using found instruments. Decide on framework's project structure
- **Phase 2**: implement App class with methods for registering controllers for given routes, which is functional, meaning that one can already implement a simple app using this class.
- **Phase 3**: implement template rendering.
- **Phase 4**: implement remaining elements: logging, session handling, optionally dependency injection

# Chosen instruments:
- HTTP library: https://github.com/daurnimator/lua-http
- HTML template language: https://github.com/bungle/lua-resty-template
